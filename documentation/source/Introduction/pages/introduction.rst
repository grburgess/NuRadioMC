Introduction
=======================================

Welcome to ``NuRadioMC``! NuRadioMC contains two packages - :doc:`NuRadioMC </NuRadioMC/pages/welcome_page>` 
is used for Monte Carlo simulations of radio neutrino detectors, and :doc:`NuRadioReco </NuRadioReco/pages/welcome_page>` 
is a reconstruction framework for radio detectors of high-energy neutrinos and cosmic rays.

Please have a look at the documentation for each package in order to familiarize yourself with how to use NuRadioMC/NuRadioReco.
Some tutorials/examples can be found :doc:`here (NuRadioMC)</NuRadioMC/pages/manuals>` or 
:doc:`here (NuRadioReco)</NuRadioReco/pages/howto_documentation>`. Additional examples are included as self-documented python
scripts in the ``examples`` or ``scripts`` subfolders of each module.
